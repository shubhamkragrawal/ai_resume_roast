# AI Resume Roaster (React Version)
This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript that uses the Google Gemini API to analyze, parse, and provide feedback on your resume.

Features
-  Resume Parsing: Upload a PDF or paste text to have the AI automatically extract and structure your resume into key sections.
- Contextual Q&A: Provide a job description to get targeted feedback on how well your experience aligns with the role.
- Interactive Roast Mode: Toggle on a special mode where the AI adopts a witty, sarcastic persona to "roast" your resume.
Text-to-Speech: Listen to the AI's roasts with generated audio.
